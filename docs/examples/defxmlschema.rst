Definitive XML Schema
=====================

Historically this was the first integration test suite of xsdata and is still being
used to make sure things still work between minor code changes.

It's based on the samples from the book
`Definitive XML Schema <http://www.datypic.com/books/defxmlschema/>`_
by Priscilla Walmsley that cover most of the basic XML Schema language traits

The test suite is using the auto generated models to parse the sample documents
and serializes them back to JSON and XML documents.
